<h2>Using Xrtti</h2>

This section gives a brief tutorial on using Xrtti.
<p>
Once your classes have had Xrtti classes generated for them, you can
use the API documented below to, at runtime, introspect on your class
definitions. Just about every aspect of your classes will be available
to you via the Xrtti API, including methods for creating instances of
your class, calling methods on such instances, accessing fields (via
get and set methods), and destroying instances created in this way.
</p><p>
The basic steps for using Xrtti with your classes are:
</p><ol>
<li>
Run the xrttigen program on the header file(s) defining your classes.
</li>
<li>
Compile the resulting C++ source file, and link this source file into your program.
</li>
<li>
Use the Xrtti API to reflect on your classes.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p><h3>Run xrttigen</h3>
<p>
The Xrtti system is currently based on the <a href="http://www.gccxml.org/">gccxml</a>
 tool, which is what actually reads in and parses your C++ header files.
  Because of this, many of the options and operations involved in this 
step are strongly related to running the g++ compiler on your code.
</p><p>
If you already use the g++ compiler, then you will find this step 
easier, since running xrttigen is very similar to running the g++ 
compiler.  If not, you will have to construct flags to xrttigen that are
 unlike those you are passing to your compiler.
</p><p>
Also, if your code compiles under g++, there is a very good chance it will work without any issues with the xrttigen program.
</p><p>
xrttigen needs to know the following information:
</p><ul>
<li>
Where to find header files included by the input header file.  These are
 specified using a -I &lt;directory&gt; (or multiple -I 
&lt;directory1&gt; -I &lt;directory2&gt; etc.) arguments.
</li><p>
</p><li>
      Which classes from the header file you are using as input to
      xrttigen should have Xrtti classes generated for them. To
      save space in the generated code, you will normally want to limit
      the xrttigen tool to processing only the classes that you define
      and that you care about.  xrttigen will also automatically include
      classes that your classes reference too, so all you really need to
      specify are the classes that xrttigen should start with, and it
      will figure out the entire set of classes necessary to produce
      complete reflection information for those classes.
<p>
      You specify which classes to include and exclude using the -i
      and -e options to xrttigen. Each subsequent -i and -e argument
      further refines the set of classes which will be processed.
</p><p>
      Normally, you'd start with "-e '*'" to tell xrttigen to not include
      any classes except the ones that you name in later -i options. This
      is important because the default behavior of xrttigen is to include
      all classes, and without "-e '*'" your subsequent -i options would be
      meaningless.
</p><p>
      Next, include an -i option for each class you want to process. You
      can use simple wildcarding: "*foo" will match all classes with names
      ending in "foo" and "foo*" will match all classes with names
      beginning with "foo". So if all of your classes are in the same
      namespace, for example, "MyNamespace", then you can simply use 
      "-i 'MyNamespace::*'; or if all of your classes begin with the same
      prefix, for example "MyLib_", you can use "-i 'MyLib_*'.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
Where to write the generated C++ code.  For example, '-o path/to/generated.cpp'.
</li><p>
</p><li>
What header file(s) to read in to get your class file definitions.  These are the last arguments to xrttigen.
</li><p>
</p></ul>
Additionally, you may optionally tell xrttigen:
<ul>
<li>
The paths to the header files included by the input header file, as they
 would appear in code that you would write.  For example, if you're 
processing a file '/home/me/project/inc/Utilities/MyClasses.h' and you 
normally include it in your code via '#include "Utilities/MyClasses.h"',
 then you would pass this to xrttigen:
<pre>-h "Utilities/MyClasses.h"
</pre>
Each header file named via "-h xxx" will result in a "#include xxx" line
 being emitted by xrttigen into the generated source file.  Thus, you 
can use this option to cause the generated output to reference header 
files as source code in your project would normally reference them 
(imagine if instead xrttigen just used the path to the header file 
itself - you'd end up with "#include 
"/home/me/project/inc/Utilities/MyClasses.h" - usually you don't want 
explicit paths in your code, and -h allows you to specify the header 
files that the generated code depends upon using relative paths).
</li><p>
</p><li>
Whether or not the Xrtti system should generate associations with C++ 
rtti information for your classes.   Associations with C++ rtti are 
enabled by default.  Normally you would want to leave this enabled, but 
if you are compiling your C++ code without C++ rtti, then then you will 
want to use the -n option to disable associations with C++ rtti 
information.
</li><p>
</p><li>
      An intermediate file is used to save the output of gccxml; it is
      normally named gccxml.out, but you can change the name
      of this file via the -t parameter
</li><p>
</p></ul>
<p>
</p><h3>xrttigen Example</h3>
Here is an example use of xrttigen, and some comments about what each argument does:
<p>
</p><pre>xrttigen     -I /home/me/project/inc                        // Add /home/me/project/inc to the header file search path
             -I /home/me/project/inc/posix                  // Add /home/me/project/inc/posix to the header file search path
             -D DEBUG                                       // Define DEBUG when processing header files
             -h inc/Util.h                                  // Put '#include "inc/Util.h"' into the generated source
             -h inc/MyClasses.h                             // Put '"#include "inc/MyClasses.h"' into the generated source
             -n                                             // Don't generate associations between C++ rtti info and Xrtti
             -e '*'                                         // Exclude all classes from processing by default
             -i MessageManager                              // But include the class named MessageManager
             -i "MyNamespace::*"                            // And also include every class in the MyNamespace namespace
             -e MyNamespace::Garbage                        // Except for MyNamespace::Garbage
             -o /home/me/project/MyNamespace_generated.cpp  // Write the generated source here
             /home/me/project/inc/MyClasses.h               // And process this file to find the class definitions
</pre>
<p>

</p><h3>Compile the generated code</h3>
Treat the generated source code just like any other source file in your
project.  Compile it and link it into your program.
<p>

</p><h3>Use the Xrtti API</h3>
You must include the Xrtti.h header file in your code to use the Xrtti API.
<p>
Now your program can call any of the Xrtti API methods to introspect on the
classes you processed.  For example, you could:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>
Iterate over all classes you processed using Xrtti::GetContextCount() and
Xrtti::GetContext().
</li>
<li>
Create an instance of one of your classes using the Create() method of the
corresponding Xrtti::Class.
</li>
<li>
Iterate over all of the methods of that class using the GetMethodCount() and
GetMethod() methods of the Xrtti::Class.
</li>
<li>
Call one of these methods using its Invoke() method.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Access to Protected and Private Classes and Members</h3>
<p>
The xrttigen tool can only generate "complete" access to public classes
and members.  This means that for protected and private classes and class
members, the following will be true:
</p><ul>
<li>Field::HasOffsetof() will return false</li>
<li>Field::IsAccessible() will return false</li>
<li>Structure::IsCreatable() will return false</li>
<li>Structure::IsDeletable() will return false</li>
<li>Destructor::/Constructor::/Method::IsInvokeable() will return false</li>
</ul>
<p>
In essence, you will be unable to call any of the Xrtti methods which
require compile-time support, since code to support this cannot be
generated by the xrttigen tool because the classes/members in question
are protected or private.
</p><p>
You can enable Xrtti access to protected and private members of classes
by declaring the following:
</p><p>
</p><pre>class XrttiAccess; // somewhere at the top of your header file, to identify
                   // XrttiAccess as a globally-scoped class

friend class ::XrttiAccess; // inside the class that you want to give the Xrtti
                            // system access to
</pre>

For example:

<pre>class XrttiAccess;

class Foo
{
public:

    void DoSomething();

private:

    friend class ::XrttiAccess;

    Foo();
    ~Foo();

    void DoSomethingElse();

    int a;
};
</pre>
<p>
With the above friend declaration, Foo is now completely accessible via
the Xrtti system and will be constructable via Structure::Create(), and
all of its fields and methods accessible as well.
