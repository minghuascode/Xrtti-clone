Description: Headers, documentation, and programs for Xrtti
 Header files, API documentation, static libraries, and the Xrtti tool.
 This package is needed only if you are using Xrtti as part of your C++
 development process. Programs built using the xrtti-devel package do
 not need to have the xrtti-devel package installed to run; they just
 need the xrtti package which includes the xrtti runtime library.
